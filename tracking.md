  - Details a state-of-the-art transformer-based tracker designed for robust tracking under camera/object blur, featuring a modular setup for research and extension.

## 3. **Kalman/Particle Filters for Predictive Tracking**

- **Python Kalman Filter Tutorials:**
  - [Pierian Training: Kalman Filter OpenCV Python Example (step-by-step)](https://pieriantraining.com/kalman-filter-opencv-python-example/)[7]
  - [OpenCV Kalman Filter with Python—object tracking basics and code](https://www.bacancytechnology.com/qanda/python/opencv-kalman-filter-with-python)[8]
  - [2D Kalman Filter for tracking a moving object—code and explanation](https://github.com/RahmadSadli/2-D-Kalman-Filter)[9]

## 4. **Optical Flow Tracking and Interpolation**

- **Lucas-Kanade (OpenCV Python):**
  - [OpenCV Doc: Optical Flow Tutorial with code](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html)[10]
  - [Lucas-Kanade's Optical Flow—Python implementation (Utkal97/Object-Tracking)](https://github.com/Utkal97/Object-Tracking)[11]
  - [YouTube: Optical Flow Object Tracking with explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrliyOsZEQE)[12]

## 5. **Advanced Bayesian and Multi-Object Tracking**

- **Bayesian Tracking (multi-object, robust to missed detections):**
  - [btrack: Bayesian Multi-object Tracking (quantumjot/btrack)](https://github.com/quantumjot/btrack)[13]
    - Python library for reconstructing trajectories—even through missed/blurry detection events.

## 6. **Basic Motion Tracking with Contours, Background Subtraction**

- [PyImageSearch: Basic motion detection and tracking with Python and OpenCV](https://pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/)[14]
- [Video Example: Motion Detection and Tracking using OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkcUgPhOlP8)[15]

### **How to Apply These Approaches**

- **Hybrid Pipelines:** Modern robust tracking systems often *combine* a fast detector (YOLO, Mask R-CNN, or a snooker-trained version) with a Kalman filter or tracklet-based tracker as fallback. For video with high blur, insert a deblurring or blur-invariant tracker module.
- **Deep Tracker Integration:** SiamRPN++ and BDTrack models are best suited for sports balls in fast/snooker-like situations; you can train these on your frames or use pretrained weights as a starting point.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the MOLT (Multiple Object Local Tracker) algorithm for robust tracking of multiple small, similar objects in low-quality, low-frame-rate video. MOLT is specifically designed for scenarios where traditional trackers struggle, such as tracking multiple balls in cue sports videos. The algorithm uses a population-based approach where each object is tracked by multiple local trackers that search for the most likely object position using both appearance features and motion constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want to track multiple small objects in low-quality video using the MOLT algorithm, so that I can maintain robust tracking even when objects are similar in appearance and the video has low frame rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tracker is initialized with initial object detections THEN the system SHALL create a population of local trackers for each detected object
2. WHEN each local tracker is created THEN the system SHALL store its position, size, and reference appearance histogram
3. WHEN the population size is configured THEN the system SHALL support 100-2000 trackers per object with different sizes based on object type
4. WHEN the white ball is detected THEN the system SHALL use a larger tracker population (e.g., 1500-2000 trackers) due to its higher speed and movement frequency
5. WHEN colored balls are detected THEN the system SHALL use a smaller tracker population (e.g., 100-500 trackers) as they move less frequently
6. WHEN objects are detected in the initial frames THEN the system SHALL use object detection inference for the first 5-6 frames to establish initial positions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want the MOLT tracker to update object positions in each frame, so that I can maintain continuous tracking throughout the video sequence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new frame is processed THEN the system SHALL compute similarity measures between each tracker's local patch and its reference histogram
2. WHEN similarity is computed THEN the system SHALL use Bhattacharyya or intersection distance for histogram comparison
3. WHEN spatial constraints are evaluated THEN the system SHALL compute distance measures to the best tracker position from the previous frame
4. WHEN weights are calculated THEN the system SHALL combine histogram similarity and spatial closeness into a total weight
5. WHEN trackers are ranked THEN the system SHALL sort the population by total weight and select the top tracker as the best position estimate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want the tracker population to be updated dynamically, so that the tracking can adapt to changing conditions and maintain robustness over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a frame is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a new population of trackers around the current best tracker for each object
2. WHEN population diversity is maintained THEN the system SHALL distribute new trackers with 50% near the best tracker, 30% near the second best, and 20% near the third best
3. WHEN exploration radius is applied THEN the system SHALL scatter new trackers within a configurable radius around selected positions
4. WHEN population size is maintained THEN the system SHALL keep the same number of trackers per object across frames
5. WHEN object-specific parameters are applied THEN the system SHALL use different exploration radii based on object type (larger for white ball, smaller for colored balls)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want the MOLT tracker to implement the common tracker interface, so that it can be used interchangeably with other tracking algorithms in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tracker is instantiated THEN the system SHALL inherit from the common Tracker abstract base class
2. WHEN the tracker is initialized THEN the system SHALL implement the init() method accepting frame and detections
3. WHEN tracking is performed THEN the system SHALL implement the update() method returning tracked object positions
4. WHEN visualization is requested THEN the system SHALL implement the visualize() method to display tracking results
5. WHEN tracker information is requested THEN the system SHALL implement the get_tracker_info() method returning algorithm details
6. WHEN the tracker is reset THEN the system SHALL implement the reset() method to clear all tracking state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want the MOLT tracker to be located in the PureCV directory, so that it follows the project's organization for traditional computer vision algorithms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tracker is implemented THEN the system SHALL place the MOLT tracker in the PureCV directory
2. WHEN the module is imported THEN the system SHALL be accessible through the PureCV package
3. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use only traditional computer vision libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy)
4. WHEN the tracker is integrated THEN the system SHALL update the PureCV __init__.py to export the MOLT tracker

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want the MOLT tracker to handle appearance-based tracking, so that it can distinguish between similar objects using color and texture features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN appearance features are extracted THEN the system SHALL compute color histograms from object patches
2. WHEN histogram comparison is performed THEN the system SHALL support both Bhattacharyya and intersection distance metrics
3. WHEN reference histograms are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain initial appearance features for each object
4. WHEN similarity weights are calculated THEN the system SHALL normalize histogram distances to [0,1] range
5. WHEN appearance features are updated THEN the system SHALL optionally support adaptive histogram updates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want the MOLT tracker to handle motion constraints, so that tracking can leverage temporal consistency and spatial relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN motion prediction is performed THEN the system SHALL predict object positions based on previous movement
2. WHEN spatial weights are calculated THEN the system SHALL compute distance from predicted positions
3. WHEN exploration radius is applied THEN the system SHALL limit tracker search within configurable bounds
4. WHEN motion models are used THEN the system SHALL support simple linear motion prediction
5. WHEN spatial constraints are enforced THEN the system SHALL prevent trackers from moving too far from expected positions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want the MOLT tracker to maintain ball count verification, so that it can detect when balls are lost or misidentified and handle snooker-specific ball counting rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tracker is initialized THEN the system SHALL accept expected ball counts for each color (5-15 red balls, 1 each for other colors)
2. WHEN tracking is performed THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor the number of tracked balls per color
3. WHEN a ball is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reassign tracking to the same ball type rather than creating new tracks
4. WHEN ball counts exceed expected numbers THEN the system SHALL merge or reassign tracks to maintain correct counts
5. WHEN ball counts fall below expected numbers THEN the system SHALL flag potential tracking losses and attempt recovery
6. WHEN colored balls (non-red) are tracked THEN the system SHALL enforce that only one ball of each color can exist simultaneously

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a computer vision developer, I want the MOLT tracker to provide comprehensive tracking results, so that I can analyze object trajectories and tracking performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking results are returned THEN the system SHALL provide object positions in standard format (x, y, width, height)
2. WHEN object identification is provided THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent object IDs across frames
3. WHEN tracking confidence is calculated THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores based on tracker weights
4. WHEN trajectory information is available THEN the system SHALL maintain object trails for visualization
5. WHEN tracking statistics are computed THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on tracker population performance
6. WHEN ball count information is provided THEN the system SHALL include current and expected ball counts in tracking results
